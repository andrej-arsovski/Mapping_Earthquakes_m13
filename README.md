# Mapping_Earthquakes_m13
## Project Overview
This project visually shows the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

To complete this project, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS websitewas used to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. The data was then added to a map.

Using JavaScript and the D3.js library the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes was retrieved from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
